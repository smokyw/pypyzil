# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create comprehensive documentation and detailed Russian comments for the pypyzil project, a Python library for scraping real estate data from Zillow with proxy support.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: The project uses `curl_cffi` for HTTP requests with browser impersonation, `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing, and includes proxy support
- **Architecture**: The project consists of 4 main modules in `src/pyzill/`:
  - `search.py`: Functions for searching properties (for sale, for rent, sold)
  - `details.py`: Functions to get property details by ID or URL
  - `parse.py`: HTML parsing functions for extracting JSON data from Next.js applications
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions for space removal, nested value access, and proxy URL generation
- **Key Functions**: `for_sale()`, `for_rent()`, `sold()`, `get_from_home_id()`, `get_from_home_url()`, `get_from_deparment_id()`, `get_from_deparment_url()`
- **Important Constraint**: Zillow API returns maximum 500 results in `mapResults`, pagination doesn't work beyond this limit
- **File Structure**: Project follows standard Python package structure with src/pyzill containing the main modules

## Recent Actions
